# Manu MÃ¤ki-Rajala
# This code implements a simple analogy search using word embeddings.
# The analogy search attempts to find relationships between the first 
# two words and applies that relationship to the third word. It then 
# finds the nearest neighbors to the resulting vector, providing the 
# best and second-best matches as analogies. The code relies on pre-trained 
# word embeddings to perform these computations.

# The project was implemented as part of the machine learning and 
# pattern recognition course.
